# coronavirus SEIR model

Simple SEIR model Python script for the COVID-19 pandemic with real world data.  
  
Purpose is to easily be able to experiment and better understand what is happening currently and what might happen in the near future.  
  
What I learned: Activating containment measures early can save lives.  
  
## Disclaimer
This is not a scientific or medical tool. Use at your own risk. BETA! There might be serious bugs.  

## Features
* SEIR epidemic model
* Reduced R0 after a certain amount of days to account for containment measures.
* Delays to allow for lagging official data etc.
* hopefully easily readable code
* Real world data automatically updated every three hours from Johns Hopkins CSSE (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/2019-nCoV) via https://github.com/ExpDev07/coronavirus-tracker-api
* country population data (https://github.com/samayo/country-json)
* check out screenshots below

## Installation / Requirements / Documentation
Needs Python 3.x installed. Tested on Ubuntu. Should run on Window and Mac, too.
  
```
$ pip3 install --upgrade numpy scipy matplotlib python-dateutil  # might need sudo -H pip3 ...
$ python3 ./main_coronaSEIR.py
read data: 843103 bytes
r0: 5.20    r1: 1.30
doubling0 every ~3.4 days
day 60
 Infected: 119363 0.2
 Infected found: 1085 0.0
 Hospital: 787 0.0
 Recovered: 44584 0.1
 Deaths: 17 0.0
data points for Italy: 40
first data: 2020-01-31
latest data: 2020-03-10 (you can update the data manually by running fetch_data.py)

$python3 ./world_data.py  # to just plot current numbers

$python3 ./deaths_per_capita.py  # might be a better measure than cases per capita
```  
No GUI, you need to alter the script and run again to experiment.  
  
Note: Make sure you got correct number for population and available ICU units for your country.
  
## ToDo
* automatic date offset
* maybe find a better fit with lower R0
* add proper list of populations
* add data about intensive care units
* use real dates instead of days?
* ventilator patients separately?
* make parsing code cleaner / simpler
* be more precise in differentiation between hospitalization and ICU
